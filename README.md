            <p>I, ANDREW GARCIA-RICO </p>
            
            <p>Agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER
            2025, ABC123, NAME OF CLASS with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. 
            
            <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be
            available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate
            for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. 

            <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
            failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. 
            
            <p>I also understand that giventhe structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online
            or even view my classmates’ code directly.</p>
            
            <p>I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit
            (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
